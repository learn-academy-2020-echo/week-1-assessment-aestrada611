# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a piece of code that performs a certain job.

  Researched answer: A function is a Javascript procedure that performs a task or calculates a value. They are reusable pieces of code that only execute when "called" and always return an output.



2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer: .map() will give go through the entire array and apply a change to all the items in the array. A .filter() will loop through the array and has a built in boolean function that will return values that meet the condition

  Researched answer: The main difference is that .filter() returns an array containing only those items in which the inner function remains true which often results in a decreased number of items in the returned array. On the other hand .map() is a method that converts each item in the array thus always returning an array with the same number of items.



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: The difference is that console.log() is used a developer tool to show us what is occurring behind the scenes. Return is what is actually getting returned after a value goes through a function.

  Researched answer:Console.log() print things to your console so as a programmer you can see the code being worked on. This is used to display a string or variable in the console window. A return statement is used to end a function and return a specified value. Return is used to move values from a the javascript function.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: They are the values that are run in the function. They are what goes into the function and results in new values

  Researched answer: Arguments are values passed to the function when it is invoked. This would mean that  they are the values that a function takes in order to produce an output.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: The two roles are navigator and driver. The navigator helps direct the driver and can often add input and ideas which the driver can follow. The driver is the only person writing code and he leads but can discuss best path to take with navigator. After some time the two programmers switch roles.

  Researched answer: A software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. There is a driver, in charge of writing the code, and a navigator, which reviews the code as it's typed. This type of coding can result in higher quality of code with fewer number of errors/bugs. The two programmers plan and discuss their work in collaboration in order to deliver high quality code. The driver often focuses on the direct goal while the navigator is can be there for quality control and to suggest improvements or modifications.



6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: I know it stands for Test driven development but I am not sure what it really means. I think it means to breaks down projects into smaller projects that get submitted for approval and pass test to be added to the main application/project.

  Researched answer: Test driven development is a useful approach when writing code because it allows you to see the steps in a much more logical approach. This way of writing code starts by first writing a test that should fail because it lacks the feature to make it pass.  This naturally helps the programmer think of the code more logically and write the simplest code to make the test pass. TDD also has the added benefit of knowing the code won't break the app during the refactor process because the test will pass.



7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: I found it super helpful when the concepts are broken down and then we do examples afterward. I also find it super useful to do the pair programing. One thing I would find super helpful is for a breakdown of the skeleton syntax for the subject we are about to cover. That will help me visualize the purpose of the characters and knowing the purpose of it all.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- Classes
== Classes are a particular type of function that contain data and behavior and are the blueprints of objects. Classes have their own scope. "new" is used when creating a new class. Constructor is used to create objects. Class names are always capitalized and PascalCased.
- React
== React is used to build webpages, mobile pages, and mobile applications. It is component based which means many small parts are joined to build the app. Everything in react are components and that is very similar to functions. In components props are passed just like arguments in a function.
- React State
== In react everything is a component. There are two types of components, those who hold state and those who do not. State is an object that stores a components dynamic data and determines how the component renders and behaves. When the state object changes the components rerender
- CRUD
== Create, Read, Update, Delete is the meaning of the acronym. CRUD demonstrates the four basic types of functionality. Create would be to add new values which are given their own id. To read is to call a function and see which values are currently in the catalog. To update is to call information about a value and change it to a new value. Delete would be the ability to remove items/values from the index.
